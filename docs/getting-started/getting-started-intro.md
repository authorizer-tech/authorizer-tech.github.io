# Getting Started - Intro

To get started with the Authorizer platform you should first [Setup a Cluster](./install/overview).

Once you've setup a cluster you can checkout these other guides to get a quickstart on how to integrate your application with the Authorizer:

* [Add a Namespace Configuration](./add-namespace-config)
* [Write a Relation Tuple](./write-relation-tuple)
* [Check a Subject's Access](./check-access)

For even more examples of how to leverage the Authorizer platform, please take a look at our [Examples](../overview/examples/examples-intro) page.
