# Examples - Intro

The Authorizer platform is extremely flexible and can support a wide-range of access-control models. If you're interested in learning more about how the Authorizer platform can support various models, please take a look at the examples below:

* [Role-based Access Control (RBAC)](./rbac)
* [Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC)](./abac)
* [Access Control Lists (ACL)](./acl)
* [Hierarchical Permissions and Inheritance](./hierarchy)
* [Advanced SubjectSet Rewrites](./advanced-rewrites) (advanced or custom models)

For in-code examples, please take a look at our official [authorizer-examples](https://github.com/authorizer-tech/authorizer-examples) repository. If you have questions about how you might support a particular model, don't hesitate to reach out on our slack channel [authorizer-tech](https://authorizer-tech.slack.com/).
