:::note
The Authorizer platform supports a standard HTTP/JSON API or [grpc](https://grpc.io) APIs backed by [protocol-buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).

Support for the HTTP/JSON API comes from the [grpc-gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) package which
is a gRPC to JSON proxy generator that follows the standard [gRPC and HTTP transcoding spec](https://google.aip.dev/127).

## CheckService
**Package**: authorizer.accesscontroller.v1alpha1

The service that performs access-control checks
based on stored Access Control Lists.

### Check
> **rpc** Check([CheckRequest](#checkrequest))
    [CheckResponse](#checkresponse)

Check performs an access-control check by looking up if a specific subject
is related to an object.

## ExpandService
**Package**: authorizer.accesscontroller.v1alpha1

The service to serve Expand RPC requests.

### Expand
> **rpc** Expand([ExpandRequest](#expandrequest))
    [ExpandResponse](#expandresponse)

Expands all the relation tuples for all of the subjects given
in the SubjectSet.

Expand follows direct and indirect SubjectSets in a depth-first fashion.

## NamespaceConfigService
**Package**: authorizer.accesscontroller.v1alpha1

The service to administer namespace configurations.

### WriteConfig
> **rpc** WriteConfig([WriteConfigRequest](#writeconfigrequest))
    [WriteConfigResponse](#writeconfigresponse)

WriteConfig upserts a namespace configuration.

If the namespace config already exists, the existing one is overwritten. If the new 
namespace config removes an existing relation, there must not be any relation tuples 
that reference it. Otherwise a FAILED_PRECONDITION status is returned.

To migrate away from a relation, please move all existing relation tuples referencing 
it over to the new relation and then delete the old relation once all tuples have been 
migrated.### ReadConfig
> **rpc** ReadConfig([ReadConfigRequest](#readconfigrequest))
    [ReadConfigResponse](#readconfigresponse)

Read a namespace configuration.

## ReadService
**Package**: authorizer.accesscontroller.v1alpha1

A service to query Access Control Lists.

### ListRelationTuples
> **rpc** ListRelationTuples([ListRelationTuplesRequest](#listrelationtuplesrequest))
    [ListRelationTuplesResponse](#listrelationtuplesresponse)

Lists relation tuples.

**NOTE**: This does not follow direct or indirect references through rewrites. If you 
need to follow indirect references through rewrites, please use the Expand API.

## WriteService
**Package**: authorizer.accesscontroller.v1alpha1

A service that defines APIs to manage relation tuple ACLs.

### WriteRelationTuplesTxn
> **rpc** WriteRelationTuplesTxn([WriteRelationTuplesTxnRequest](#writerelationtuplestxnrequest))
    [WriteRelationTuplesTxnResponse](#writerelationtuplestxnresponse)

Mutates one or more relation tuples within a single transaction.

## WatchService
**Package**: authorizer.accesswatcher.v1alpha1

A service defining APIs to watch for changes to namespaces.

### Watch
> **rpc** Watch([WatchRequest](#watchrequest))
    [WatchResponse](#watchresponse)

Watches for changes to relation tuples in one or more namespaces.

## Messages
### RelationTuple {#relationtuple}
RelationTuple relates an object with a subject.

While a tuple reflects a relationship between object
and subject, they do not completely define the effective ACLs.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| namespace | [ string](#string) | The namespace this relation tuple lives in. |
| object | [ string](#string) | The object identifier related by this tuple.<br/><br/>Objects live within the namespace of the tuple. |
| relation | [ string](#string) | The relation between the Object and the Subject. |
| subject | [ Subject](#subject) | The subject related by this tuple. |

### Subject {#subject}
Subject is either a concrete subject id string or
a SubjectSet expanding to more Subjects.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| [**oneof**](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#oneof) ref.id | [ string](#string) | A concrete subject id string for the subject. |
| [**oneof**](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#oneof) ref.set | [ SubjectSet](#subjectset) | A SubjectSet that expands to more Subjects. |

### SubjectSet {#subjectset}
A SubjectSet refers to all subjects which have the same
relation to an object.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| namespace | [ string](#string) | The namespace of the object and relation referenced in this SubjectSet. |
| object | [ string](#string) | The object selected by the subjects. |
| relation | [ string](#string) | The relation between the object and the subject(s). |


### CheckRequest {#checkrequest}
The request for a CheckService.Check rpc.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| namespace | [ string](#string) | The namespace to evaluate the check within. |
| object | [ string](#string) | The object to check. |
| relation | [ string](#string) | The relation between the object and the subject. |
| subject | [ Subject](#subject) | The subject to check. |
| snaptoken | [ string](#string) | Optional. The snapshot token that encodes the evaluation timestamp that this request will be evaluated no earlier than.<br/><br/>If no snapshot token is provided the check request is evaluated against the most recently replicated version of the relation tuple storage. Leaving an empty snapshot token will reflect the latest changes, but it may incur a read penalty because the reads have to be directed toward the leaseholder of the replica that serves the data.<br/><br/>We call requests without a snapshot token a content-change check, because such requests require a round-trip read but return the most recent writes and are thus good candidates for checking real-time content changes before an object is persisted. |

### CheckResponse {#checkresponse}
The response for a CheckService.Check rpc.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| allowed | [ bool](#bool) | A boolean indicating if the specified subject is related to the requested object.<br/><br/>It is false by default if no ACL matches. |
| snaptoken | [ string](#string) | A snapshot token encoding the snapshot evaluation timestamp that the request was evaluated at. |


### ExpandRequest {#expandrequest}
The request for an ExpandService.Expand rpc.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| subject_set | [ SubjectSet](#subjectset) | The SubjectSet to expand. |
| snaptoken | [ string](#string) | Optional. The snapshot token that encodes the evaluation timestamp that this request will be evaluated no earlier than.<br/><br/>If no snapshot token is provided the expand request is evaluated against the most recently replicated version of the relation tuple storage. Leaving an empty snapshot token will reflect the latest changes, but it may incur a read penalty because the reads have to be directed toward the leaseholder of the replica that serves the data. |

### ExpandResponse {#expandresponse}
The response for an ExpandService.Expand rpc.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

### ComputedSubjectset {#computedsubjectset}
Computes the set of subjects that have the included relation within the
same namespace.

This is useful to follow relations between an object and subject within
the same namespace. If you want anyone with an 'editor' relation to also
have 'viewer' this would be a good fit.

A namespace config defines the relations that exist between objects and subjects in
in a namespace.

Relations can have rewrite rules that specify how the relation is
computed relative to other relations defined within the same namespace
or across other namespaces.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| name | [ string](#string) | The name of the relation (e.g. viewer, editor, or member). |
| rewrite | [ Rewrite](#rewrite) | The rewrite rule for this relation, or nil if it references itself. |

sub-expression can be recursive and thus allows arbitrary logical expressions to be constructed.

### SetOperation.Child.This {#setoperationchildthis}
This references the defined relation directly.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |

### TupleToSubjectset {#tupletosubjectset}
Computes a tupleset from the input object, fetches relation tuples matching the
tupleset, and computes the set of subjects from every fetched relation tuple.

This is useful to lookup relations in other namespaces or to create complex hierarchies
between objects in multiple namespaces.

| Field | Type | Description |

specify any optional field to partially filter for
specific relation tuples.
